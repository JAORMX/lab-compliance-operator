Introduction
============

This workshop provides an introduction to deploying a the
[compliance-operator](https://github.com/openshift/compliance-operator).

In this lab we'll use the E8 benchmark. This benchmark was chosen
as it's fairly lightweight compared to other benchmarks.

One thing to note is that you'll need `cluster-admin` privileges in your
cluster in order to install the operator. You'll also need an OpenShift 4.6
cluster or higher in order to use the operator.

After making sure that you have the appropriate privileges in
the cluster, you may proceeed to [next section of the lab](exercises/01-compliance-operator.md).
